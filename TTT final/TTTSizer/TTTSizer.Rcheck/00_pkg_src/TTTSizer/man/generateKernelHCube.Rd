\usage{
generateKernelHCube(piVector, p0Vector, hVector, kernel)
}
\arguments{
\item{piVector}{The vector with all the frecuencies (can be a vector of size one)}

\item{p0Vector}{The vector with only the p0 values (can be a vector of size one)}

\item{hVector}{The vector with only the h's values (can be a vector of size one)}

\item{kernel}{The selected kernel function ("gaussian", "biweight", "triweight", "epanechnikov")}
}
\value{
A list of matrixs with all the K_h(pi-p0) combinations pre-calculated.
    Where the index of the list represent the h value, the row is pi and the column p0

    The row is the h, the column is the sum(K_h(pi-p0))
}
\description{
For a given vector of pi's and h's, generate all possible K_h(pi-p0) combinations.
}
