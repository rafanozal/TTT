Description: A new graphic tool is presented to test aging trends based on lifetime data.
    The graphical test is developed by means of scale and space inference about
    the Total-Time-on-Test transform and its first and second derivatives. The
    graphic tool TTT-SiZer is defined considering nonparametric local polynomial
    kernel estimators and constructing the corresponding (simultaneous as
    well as punctual) confidence intervals around three different curves. The
    finite sample properties of the method are evaluated by a simulation study and
    the comparison with other non-graphical tests shows that the graphical test
    helps localize discrepancies of empirical data concerning a given hypothesized
    aging property, thus allowing to solve the problem locally.
