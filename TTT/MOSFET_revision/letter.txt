Subject:	Decision on your Manuscript #JAMT-D-21-03452
Dear Dr Gamiz:

We have received the reports from our advisors on your manuscript, "Statistical supervised learning with engineering data: A case study of low frequency noise measured on semiconductor devices", which you submitted to The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology.

Based on the advice received, I feel your manuscript could be accepted for publication should you be prepared to incorporate minor revisions.
When preparing your revised manuscript, you are asked to carefully consider the reviewer comments which are attached, and submit a list of responses to the comments.
Your list of responses should be uploaded as a file in addition to your revised manuscript.

Reviewer #1: This paper studies the relationship between noise and voltage from the perspective of statistical learning, 
and finally establishes a model that can quantify the influence of threshold voltage on the noise signal. 
There are few researches in this direction at present, and it has research value. This research is of great help 
to the machine learning technology in the field of electronic engineering.


Reviewer #2: After the revision, it seems to me that the contribution is sufficient. The authors propose a new approach
 for the analysis of potential correlations between spectral noise current and threshold voltage from common on-wafer MOSFETs.
 The manuscript entitled " Statistical supervised learning with engineering data: A case study of low frequency noise measured on semiconductor devices " 
has been investigated in detail. The study seems very valuable. The topic addressed in the manuscript is potentially interesting and 
the manuscript contains some practical meanings, however, there are some issues which should be addressed by the authors:


There are some revisions need for the article to be eligible for possible publication.

1. The paper is in need of substantial editing for grammatical errors especially in:
a. In page 7 the paragraph " suggested by figure ??" , and the same for the " left and side of the figure â€¦." Number of figure is needed.
b. In figure 3 the y axis represent what ? the same for the figure 6 ,7,8,9,10,12,13.

2. In section 1, The justification of the proposed method is needed based on model was designed based on statistical supervised learning? 
And what are some of the advantages and disadvantages of bootstrapping?
3. The manuscript not contain a flowchart or graphical representation of a process of optimization. This pictorial representation can give 
step-by-step solution of the given problem, and What is the convergence criteria for program terminated?
4. How to avoid the transit time noise or partition noise for the proposed approach ?
5. In section 4; How to set the parameters of proposed model for better performance? The complexity of the proposed model and the model parameter uncertainty are not mentioned.
6. In section 5, the performances of the proposed method should be better analyzed, commented and visualized in the experimental section.
7. Conclusion can be more specific listing the efficiency when compared with other methods and the future scope of the work implemented on this paper.
